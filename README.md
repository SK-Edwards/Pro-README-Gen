  # Description
 
 When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a high-quality README file for the application.
The README contains a description of the applications as well as other developer relevant deatials.
This CLI application was designed to dynamically generate a professinal README.md file from a users input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).
